cassiopy
========

**Cassiopy** is a python library dedicated to clustering using `skew-t <https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2342>`_ mixture models. It offers powerful tools for working with skew-t distributions, including sample generation, density calculation, and more.

Main Features
-------------

- **Skew-t Clustering**: Utilize skew-t mixture models to perform complex clustering tasks for asymetric data.
- **Uniform Background**: Use skew-t uniform mixture models to cluster data with a uniform background.
- **Sampling and Density**: Generate samples and calculate densities for skew-t distributions.
